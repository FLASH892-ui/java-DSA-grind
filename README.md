# Java DSA Grind ☕

This repository documents my journey mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. It contains optimized solutions to problems from AccioJob contests and other platforms, focusing on clean code and efficient time complexity.

## 📂 Problems Solved

### Arrays
| Problem | Key Concept | Time Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New Boy In School** | Finding common elements between two arrays without duplicates. | **O(N + M)** |
| **Min & Max Difference** | Calculating price gaps efficiently. | **O(N log N)** |

* **Optimization Note:** For *New Boy In School*, I utilized a `HashSet` to reduce lookup time to O(1) instead of using nested loops. For *Min/Max Difference*, I used sorting to avoid the brute-force O(N²) approach.

### Matrix (2D Arrays)
| Problem | Key Concept | Time Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Life Bar** | Traversing a 2D grid to find the row with the maximum "lives". | **O(N * M)** |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **Tools:** Arrays, ArrayList, HashSet, StringBuilder
